  The goal of this repport is to identify key insights into what is popular on the Google Playstore App. This should offer guidance as to what is popular and where to make money.

<!-- First: Set your default preferences for chunk options: -->

<!-- If you want a chunk's code to be printed, set echo = TRUE. message = FALSE stops R printing ugly package loading details in your final paper too. I also suggest setting warning = FALSE and checking for warnings in R, else you might find ugly warnings in your paper. -->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 5, fig.pos="H", fig.pos = 'H')
# Note: Include = FALSE implies the code is executed, but not printed in your pdf.
# warning and message = FALSE implies ugly messages and warnings are removed from your pdf.
# These should be picked up when you execute the command chunks (code sections below) in your rmd, not printed in your paper!

# Lets load in example data, and see how this can be stored and later called from your 'data' folder.
if(!require("tidyverse")) install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)

# Introduction \label{Introduction}

The Google Play store offers an array of applications for consumers to download. Some are free, whilst others require money. This offers an opportunity to identify where profit lies and where popularity lies. 

# Data
The data sets are not neat. This requires R applications to wrangle and tidy the data. This is done in each R script code.
<!-- The following is a code chunk. It must have its own unique name (after the r), or no name. After the comma follows commands for R which are self-explanatory. By default, the code and messages will not be printed in your pdf, just the output: -->

```{r Figure1,  warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Average Rating by App Category \\label{Figure1}", fig.ext = 'png', fig.height = 5, fig.width = 6}
source("code/data.R")
source("code/play.R")
p <- play_bar(playstore)
p

```
The graph above provides an average rating, out of 5, of the top five most popular apps on the playstore. The number above each bar category is the average number of installs in each. It is clear to see that these categories are extremely popular, judging from their downloads, and their average ratings are almost identical. 

## Profit?
How many paid applications are available on the playstore, and what insight can this provide. The tbale below will indicate this. 
```{r Figure2, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Free or Paid \\label{Figure2}", fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6, dev = 'png'}
source("code/data.R")
source("code/proportion.R")
c <- prop(playstore)
c

```

uploading a paid application on the app store means that the application will be competing with less than 1 percent of the other paid applications. However, this does not mean that paid applications are the only competition for the possible paid app.
